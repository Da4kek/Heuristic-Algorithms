### What is an Evolutionary Algorithm?
```markdown
Evolutionary computation is a very powerful generic 
optimization technique that draws its main inspiration from 
the theory of evolution by natural selection. Evolution by 
natural selection is a very elegant theory that depends for 
its explanation of the biodiversity in nature on two main 
components:
1. Random mutations
2. Selection pressure
```
Different ecological habitats have different challenges and requirements for survival. According to the **evolutionary theory**, in any ecological niche, the different organisms’ traits will be variant due to random mutations in DNA and copying mistakes in its duplication. Due to this variation in traits, there will be differential advantages of survival for organisms having more suitable traits for survival, i.e the nature is implicitly applying a pressure that selects for the fit individuals. Because the most fit organisms will be more probable to survive, they will pass their ‘fit’ genes to their offsprings, which will be again more probable to survive.
