*Before you go through the readme, do check the [wiki](https://github.com/The-DarK-os/Heuristic-Algorithms/wiki).I've put a lot of efforts in there.*

> A heuristic algorithm is a type of algorithm that uses problem solving, learning, and self-correcting capabilities to find the best possible solution to a problem. Heuristic algorithms are used in a variety of fields, including computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Heuristic algorithms are often used technique for a variety of reasons:

* Problems that are too complex to solve using traditional algorithms.
* Calculations of bounds on the optimal solution in branch and bound algorithms.
* Problems that do not have a known solution.

## Methodoloy:
#### There are two types of heuristic algorithms:
1. Local search
2. Construction methods (Greedy algorithms)

**Local search:**
> Local search algorithms are used to find a local optimum. A local optimum is a solution that is better than all other solutions in the neighborhood of the solution. A neighborhood is a set of solutions that are close to the solution. Local search algorithms are used to find a local optimum by moving from one solution to another solution in the neighborhood. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local optimum.

**Construction methods:**
> The greedy algorithm works by constructing a solution one piece at a time. The algorithm starts with an empty solution and then adds pieces to the solution until the solution is complete. The algorithm chooses the piece that is best for the current solution. The algorithm stops when the solution is complete.
